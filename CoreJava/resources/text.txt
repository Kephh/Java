Got it — you’re wondering about **two things**:

1. **Why logging in with Google starts a chat thread**
2. **How that first “good-looking” query appeared without you typing it**

Let’s break it down:

---

### **1. Why logging in starts a thread**

* When you log into ChatGPT (Google Sign-In or otherwise), the system opens a *new conversation instance* automatically.
* The conversation ID is created the moment you land on the chat interface — even if you don’t type anything.
* This ensures that if you type something right away, the system knows which “chat” it belongs to.

Think of it like WhatsApp automatically opening a blank chat when you click on someone’s name — the chat technically “exists” before your first message.

### **2. How a pre-filled or well-formatted query can appear**

This can happen for a few reasons:

* **Browser Autocomplete / Clipboard** — If you had copied something earlier, some extensions or autofill scripts can paste it into the chat box.
* **Third-party redirect** — If you clicked a special link that included a pre-written query (like `chat.openai.com/?q=...`), ChatGPT will open with that text already in place.
* **Google Sign-In redirect script** — If the site you used to log in had an embedded ChatGPT “Ask” button, it could pass a default query when redirecting you here.

If you want, I can **teach you how to check the browser’s developer console** so we can see *exactly* what data got sent to ChatGPT right after login. That way, you’ll know whether it was just a blank login or a preloaded query injection.

Do you want me to walk you through that? That’s where the real “learning” part gets fun.
