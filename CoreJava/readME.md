# Java Core Self-Assessment

This repository contains small Java programs to self-assess and master core Java concepts.

## Structure and order is as follows

- `Level1.Basics` - basic programming, control flow, arrays, strings
    `FizzBuzz`
    -->`StringStats`
    -->`Secondlargest`
    -->`PrimeNums`
    -->`ArgsParser`
- `Level2.OOPs` - object-oriented programming, exceptions, collections
    `Student`
    -->`Shape`
    -->`Bank`
- `Level3.Concurrency` - file I/O and multithreading/concurrency

## How to run

Each task has a `main` method. Run them individually in your IDE or from the command line.

## Usage tips

- Try to complete each task within 20-40 minutes without external help initially.
- Document challenges and time taken.
- Push commits frequently with descriptive messages.
- After completing core tasks, try refactoring with Java 8+ features.
